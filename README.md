## Introduction
Unsupervised learning algorithms are used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. Unlike supervised learning, there are no explicit output labels to predict. The techniques covered in this repository are essential for data exploration, data preprocessing, and gaining insights from data.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a dimension reduction technique used to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. It transforms the original variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components, ordered by the amount of variance they capture from the data.

### Key Concepts
- Variance and covariance
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Explained variance ratio

### Applications
- Data visualization
- Noise reduction
- Feature extraction

## Recommendation Systems
Recommendation systems are algorithms designed to suggest items to users based on various data sources. They are widely used in e-commerce, streaming services, and social media platforms.

### Types of Recommendation Systems
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user-item interactions to make recommendations.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses item features to recommend items similar to those a user has shown interest in.
- **Hybrid Methods**: Combine collaborative and content-based filtering approaches.

### Key Concepts
- User-item matrix
- Similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity, Pearson correlation)
- Matrix factorization

## Dimension Reduction Techniques
Apart from PCA, other dimension reduction techniques are also crucial in preprocessing high-dimensional data. These techniques help in improving model performance and reducing computational cost.

### Techniques Covered
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: Used for data visualization by reducing dimensions while preserving the structure.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Finds the linear combinations of features that best separate two or more classes of objects.
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks used for learning efficient codings of unlabeled data.

## K-means Clustering
K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization that aims to partition n observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

### Key Concepts
- Centroids
- Inertia (sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned centroid)
- Elbow method for selecting the number of clusters

### Applications
- Customer segmentation
- Image compression
- Anomaly detection

## Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters either by a bottom-up approach (agglomerative) or a top-down approach (divisive).

### Key Concepts
- Dendrogram: A tree-like diagram that records the sequences of merges or splits.
- Linkage criteria (single, complete, average, ward)
- Distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan)

### Applications
- Gene sequence analysis
- Social network analysis
- Market research
